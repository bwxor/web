# Oh, hi there!

## whoami?
Welcome to my page. I'm a Romanian computer engineer currently working my way through a master's degree in Software Engineering. My "fields of expertise" include (but are not limited to) object-oriented programming (especially in Java) and web development. I'm also comfortable with .NET, more especially its desktop development area built on the mature Windows Forms. Several projects (listed on my [Projects](projects) page are built on that). I'd be more than happy if you tried some of them and gave me some feedback [per mail](mailto:mario@bwxor.com).

## What about bwxor.com?
I didn't want to pick a domain too attached to my name. Maybe this is going to become a community someday and people will work alongside me on the already existing projects. The weird "bwxor" comes from nothing more that "Bitwise XOR" (as "bwand" and "bwor" were already taken). But you can't disagree: it sounds cool!

This website is 100% frontend (and, obviously, 0% backend). I'm not using any database for it. This is a React app that shows certain capabilities of the gross language of the fallen called "JavaScript", while the content present on each page is mostly rendered Markdown text. The app basically reads locally (or remotely) stored Markdown files and displays them, according to different rules. Markdown's easy syntax was the deal breaker for me. I won't need to manually write all those HTML tags to add new content on my website. Fuck it!

## More about me
I'm pretty active on [GitHub](https://github.com/mateasmario) and most active on my [Pie repository](https://github.com/mateasmario/pie). But you can also find me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mario.mateas) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mateasmario). My CV is my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-matea%C8%99-b31628209/). Feedback regarding my work or any type of questions can be addressed both on social media and on my [e-mail address](mailto:mario@bwxor.com).
